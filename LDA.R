## Linear Discriminant Analysis

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a dimensionality reduction technique. As the name implies dimensionality reduction techniques reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. Linear Discriminant Analysis, or LDA, uses the information from features to create a new axis and projects the data on to the new axis in such a way as to minimizes the variance and maximizes the distance between the means of the  classes.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
